snake_original is the original snake code obfuscated.
The VM present in snake_original DOES NOT have the NOP instruction.

snake_nopified is the original snake bytecode with lots of NOP instructions
inserted in the bytecode. The VM present in snake_nopified DOES have the NOP
instruction.

The NOP vm can be used with the original code as it doesn't use NOPs, but the
nopified code must use the NOP vm.
