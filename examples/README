Each example has a 'template' and 'playground' folder.

Use the bytecode in the template folder with the disassembler script and modify
it (through NOPify and obf_strings actions). Then use the export action to get
the encoded bytecode string after modification.

Copy this string into the index.html in the 'playground' folder so that the VM
gets initialised with it. Open this file in the browser to verify the
modifications worked!

Importantly, don't modify stuff template folders - that is the base version of
the VM / bytecode produced from Rusty-JSYC.
